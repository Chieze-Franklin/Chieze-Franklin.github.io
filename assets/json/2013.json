		"summary": "Co-founded an online gaming software company called Coinaire.",
		"detail": "Sometime in 2013 I travelled to Lagos to help start Coinaire. Coinaire was an online gaming site where\n people played games for reward. We made simple JavaScript games, and you got rewarded based on your performance.\n The idea was simple: the reward system would attract a lot of people, and that large number\n would attract advertisers. The first reward we gave was airtime. People played games to win recharge cards.\n Our plan was to build the site into a gaming platform on which any game developer could host his game, and then get\n about 70% of the advert revenue got from adverts that are visible to those playing his game. It was also going to be\n a digital economy where people could win digital money from playing games and hosting tournaments, and have the option\n of converting that digital money to actual real-world money."
