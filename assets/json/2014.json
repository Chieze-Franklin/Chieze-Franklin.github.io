		"summary": "Co-founded an alternative-payment software company called Knitle.",
		"detail": "In 2014 I travelled to Ibadan to help build Knitle. Knitle was social commerce solution. Marketers\n created QR-codes for their products. The QR-Codes contained every information needed by a customer,\n including payment information. Marketers then placed the codes on their products. Customers then scanned\n the codes with our apps, and this scanning enabled them to pay. It was a \"scan to pay\" feature.\n It was also a social solution because any time you paid for a product, it\n appeared on your various social networks telling your friends and followers \"I just bought\n [insert item name] from [insert shop name]\". This was also a massive advert opportunity for sellers."
